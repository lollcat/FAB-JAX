# Flow Annealed Importance Sampling Bootstrap (FAB) with Jax
See [`examples/gmm.py`] for a simple example of running FAB.
This library is currently being built - I will be steadily adding more features and improving the documentation.

# Key tips
 - For FAB to work well we need SMC to preform reasonably well, where by reasonble we just mean that it produces samples that are
better than samples from the flow by a noticeable margin.
If applying FAB to a new problem, make sure that transition operator has a well tuned step size.
Having good plotting tools for visualising samples from the flow and SMC can be very helpful for diagnosing performance.
 - For getting started with a new problem we recommend starting with a small toy version of the problem, getting that to work
well, and then to move onto more challenging versions of the problem. 


# Library
Key components of FAB:
- `sampling`: Running SMC with a trainable base q, and target p, targetting the optimal distribution for estimating alpha-divergence.
   - `metropolis`: Propose step by adding Gaussian noise to sample and then accept/reject. Includes step size tuning.
   - `hmc`: Hamiltonean Monte Calro. I still need to get the step size tuning to be robust for this.
- `buffer`: Prioritised replay buffer. 
these are written to be self-contained such that they can be easily ported into an existing code base.

Additionally, we have
 - `flow`: Create normalizing flows (using distrax).
 - `targets`: energy functions for training
 - `train`: training script for fab (not modular, but can be copy and pasted and adapted)


# TODO:
 - Use sum-tree for prioritised buffer implementation. Would be nice to do everything with log probs.
 - make nice target distribution abstractions
 - Could use exponential moving average for flow params used in SMC (i.e. target network).
