# Flow Annealed Importance Sampling Bootstrap (FAB) with Jax
[[FAB paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.01893)

See `experiments` for training runs on various common problems using FAB.

This library is currently being built - I will be steadily adding more features, results and improving the documentation.



## Install
```shell
pip install -e .
```

## Key tips
 - Please reach out to us if you would like us to help apply FAB to a problem of interest!
 - For FAB to work well we need SMC to preform reasonably well, where by reasonble we just mean that it produces samples that are
better than samples from the flow by a noticeable margin.
If applying FAB to a new problem, make sure that transition operator has a well tuned step size.
Having good plotting tools for visualising samples from the flow and SMC can be very helpful for diagnosing performance.
 - For getting started with a new problem we recommend starting with a small toy version of the problem, getting that to work
well, and then to move onto more challenging versions of the problem.


## Library
Key components of FAB:
- `sampling`: Running SMC with a trainable base q, and target p, targetting the optimal distribution for estimating alpha-divergence.
   - `metropolis`: Propose step by adding Gaussian noise to sample and then accept/reject. Includes step size tuning.
   - `hmc`: Hamiltonean Monte Carlo. Simple step size tuning.
- `buffer`: Prioritised replay buffer. 

these are written to be self-contained such that they can be easily ported into an existing code base.

Additionally, we have
 - `flow`: Create minimal real-nvp/spline normalizing flow for the gmm problem (using distrax).
 - `targets`: Target distributions to be fit.
 - `train`: Training script for fab (not modular, but can be copy and pasted and adapted).


## Experiments
Current problems include `cox`, `funnel` `gmm_v0` `gmm_v1` and `many_well`.
